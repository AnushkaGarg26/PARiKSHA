# PARiKSHA-Frontend

We are developing a unified online platform (PARiKSHA) in the form of a website for conducting assessments and taking assignments, storing the responses for grading and automatically producing performance analytics, and extending upon these providing institutions, teachers and students a place to maintain and access results.
Administrators and teachers will create online equivalent of their institutions and classes where the students would create accounts and enroll. Teachers can choose from test templates like Multiple Choice Questions, subjective papers, etc. or create them from scratch, choose manual or automatic grading, set invigilation - none, manual or AI based and publish and schedule the tests for students.
Students will be able to use our platform from laptops, smartphones, and tablets to give the tests or submit assignments and view results among other things.

Would be updating the repo time to time as we go along the development of the frontend for the best online exam conducting app PARiKSHA.
